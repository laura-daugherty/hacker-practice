1. Area of the Box
Given a box of chocolate bars of dimension N × M, choose an area a × a  such that for all a, 1 ≤ a ≤ min(N,M). Given multiple values of N and M, find the number of ways to choose the area of dimension a x a from the box of dimension N x M for all a.

 

For example, given a box of bars where N = 2 and M = 2, there is one way to have a 2 x 2 bar, and there are 4 ways to choose a 1 x 1 bar. In this case, the number of ways to choose a x a bars for all valid values of  a is 5.

 
Function Description

Explanation

There are T = 2 test cases.

In 1st test case is N=2, M=1.

The number of ways to select an area of dimension 1 is 2.

 

In the 2nd test case, N=2, M=3.

The number of ways to select the area of dimension 1 is 6 and of dimension 2 is 2.

Hence the output is 6+2=8.
